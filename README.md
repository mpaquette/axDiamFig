# Realistic Axon Diameter Estimation from dMRI
&nbsp;

This repo contains the simulation functions and plotting functions used in the paper [(bioRxiv link)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.01.320507v1)

**Axon Diameter Measurements using Diffusion MRI are Infeasible**.

All figure making scripts are self contains, generating the data and then plotting it.
